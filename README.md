# GAN Inversion for Laten Space Analysis

This project explores image manipulation through GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) inversion, specifically focusing on object rotation in car images. We leverage the `encoder4editing` framework, created by Omer Tov et al., to map images to a latent space, perform manipulations, and reconstruct the images. We thank the authors for providing the model and framework based on which this project is built.

## Overview

This repository contains code and experiments for the "Generative AI: Can we find meaning in the latent space?" project from the Deep Learning course, ES431, IIT Gandhinagar. The goal is to explore image manipulation using GANs, specifically through object rotation in car images by encoding them to a latent space and manipulating those latent codes.
